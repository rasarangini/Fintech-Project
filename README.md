May 24- June 24
In the rapidly evolving banking sector, customer retention has become a critical concern. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset to identify key predictors of customer churn. 
 By leveraging data analytics tools such as Python,statistics, probability, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that could enhance customer retention and reduce churn rates.
Churn Among Mid-Age Customers: The 46-65 age group shows higher exit counts, accounting for around 4.9% of churn. Recommendation: Investigate the specific needs and pain points of this age group. 
Customer Experience in Germany: Germany has the highest churn rate, despite France having the most customers. Recommendation: Focus on improving the customer experience in Germany.
Female Customer Churn: Female customers have a higher churn rate compared to male customers. Recommendation: Develop and promote special schemes or offers for female customers.
Product and Service Engagement: Most customers use only 1 or 2 products. Recommendation: Encourage customers to use more bank products by offering bundled services at discounted rates.
Activity Level: Active members are less likely to churn. Recommendation: Increase customer engagement through regular communication, loyalty programs, and exclusive events.
Addressing 0 Balance: Many customers maintain a 0 balance, which might lead to dissatisfaction and churn. Recommendation: Introduce 0-balance account options or reduce minimum balance requirements to alleviate this issue.
Customer Complaints: Customers who have filed complaints are more likely to churn. Recommendation: Enhance the complaint resolution process to ensure timely and satisfactory responses. Implement a follow-up system to check on the customer's satisfaction.
Increasing Customer Satisfaction: The average satisfaction score is around 3, indicating a mixed sentiment among customers. Recommendation: Conduct regular customer satisfaction surveys to identify areas for improvement.In the rapidly evolving banking sector, customer retention has become a critical concern.
